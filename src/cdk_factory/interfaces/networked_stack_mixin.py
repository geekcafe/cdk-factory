    Combined mixin for stacks that need both SSM imports and VPC resolution.
    
    This mixin provides a complete solution for network-aware stacks by combining:
    - Enhanced SSM parameter import functionality (with caching and list support)
    - VPC resolution with multiple fallback strategies
    - Standardized initialization patterns
