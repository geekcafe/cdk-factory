# Securing Your CloudFront Distribution: Lambda@Edge IP Gating vs AWS WAF

## The Problem: Locking Down Your Dev and Staging Environments

You've just deployed your beautiful new React app to a CloudFront distribution. Your development and staging environments are live, accessible via HTTPS, and... completely open to the internet. 

Within hours, your boss gets an email from a competitor: "Hey, saw your new redesign. Nice work!" 

**Oops.** ü§¶

You need to lock down access to your non-production environments, but you don't want to:
- Set up a VPN (too much overhead for the team)
- Use Basic Auth (breaks Single Page Apps and feels clunky)
- Spend $60/month on AWS WAF for a dev site that costs $5/month to run

**Enter Lambda@Edge IP gating**: A cost-effective, elegant solution that validates IP addresses at the CloudFront edge before serving content.

## The Use Case: Why IP Gating Matters

### Development and Staging Environments

The most common use case for IP gating is protecting non-production environments:

**The Challenge:**
- You need external stakeholders (clients, partners, remote team) to access your staging site
- You don't want the site indexed by Google or discovered by competitors
- You don't want to pay enterprise prices for a simple access control mechanism
- You need flexibility to add/remove IPs quickly without redeploying

**The Solution:**
IP gating with Lambda@Edge provides:
- ‚úÖ **Selective access** - Only approved IPs can view the site
- ‚úÖ **Maintenance mode** - Redirect unauthorized users to a maintenance page
- ‚úÖ **Cost-effective** - Pennies per month for low-traffic dev sites
- ‚úÖ **Zero VPN overhead** - Team members just need to be on the office network or VPN
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic updates** - Change the allow-list via SSM Parameter Store without redeploying

### Partner Portals and Beta Programs

Beyond dev environments, IP gating shines for:

**Partner Portals:**
- Restrict access to specific partner organizations by their office IP ranges
- Provide secure document sharing without complex authentication
- Compliance requirement: "only accessible from approved networks"

**Closed Beta Programs:**
- Allow beta testers from specific companies
- Prevent public access during private beta phase
- Quickly add/remove beta participant companies

**Internal Tools:**
- Restrict admin dashboards to corporate network
- Prevent accidental public exposure of internal tools
- Compliance: "administrative interfaces must not be publicly accessible"

## How Lambda@Edge IP Gating Works

The architecture is beautifully simple:

```
User Request ‚Üí CloudFront Edge Location
                    ‚Üì
            Lambda@Edge Function
                    ‚Üì
        Check IP against Allow-List (from SSM)
                    ‚Üì
        ‚úÖ Allowed ‚Üí Serve Content
        ‚ùå Blocked ‚Üí Redirect OR Proxy to Lockout Page
```

**The Lambda function:**
1. Extracts the client's IP from the CloudFront request headers
2. Fetches the allow-list from SSM Parameter Store (cached via `@lru_cache`)
3. Checks if the IP matches any CIDR block in the allow-list
4. If blocked, either:
   - **Redirect mode**: Returns HTTP 302 to lockout page (URL changes)
   - **Proxy mode**: Fetches lockout page content and returns it (URL stays the same)

### Two Response Modes

**Redirect Mode (Default)**
```python
# Returns HTTP 302
return {
    'status': '302',
    'headers': {
        'location': [{'value': f'https://{dns_alias}'}]
    }
}
```
- User sees the lockout URL in their browser
- Simple and fast
- Clear indication they've been blocked

**Proxy Mode (Advanced)**
```python
# Fetches and returns lockout page content
import urllib3
http = urllib3.PoolManager()
response = http.request('GET', f'https://{dns_alias}/index.html')
return {
    'status': '200',
    'body': response.data.decode('utf-8')
}
```
- User stays on the original URL
- Better user experience (less confusing)
- Slightly higher latency (~100-200ms for fetch)
- Falls back to redirect if proxy fails

**Configuration is simple:**

```json
{
  "cloudfront": {
    "enable_ip_gating": true
  }
}
```

That's it! The CDK Factory framework:
- Creates the Lambda@Edge function
- Configures SSM parameters for the allow-list
- Associates the function with your CloudFront distribution
- Sets up proper IAM permissions

**Updating the allow-list:**

```bash
# Add a new office IP
aws ssm put-parameter \
  --name "/dev/my-app/lambda-edge/allow-cidrs" \
  --value "203.0.113.0/24,198.51.100.0/24,192.0.2.0/24" \
  --type StringList \
  --overwrite

# Changes take effect within 5 minutes (cache expiration)
```

No deployment required!

## Lessons Learned: Real-World Implementation Gotchas

When we first implemented this system, we encountered several subtle issues that aren't immediately obvious from the documentation. Here's what we learned the hard way:

### Gotcha #1: CloudFront Domain vs DNS Alias

**The Problem:**
Our initial proxy mode implementation fetched content from the raw CloudFront domain:
```python
# ‚ùå This returns 403!
response = http.request('GET', f'https://d14pisygxjo4bs.cloudfront.net/index.html')
```

Result: Google's 403 error page instead of our beautiful lockout page.

**The Root Cause:**
CloudFront distributions with custom domain names (aliases) and host header restrictions only accept requests with the proper `Host` header. When you hit the raw CloudFront domain, it doesn't match any configured aliases and returns 403.

**The Solution:**
Always use the DNS alias (custom domain) in your proxy requests:
```python
# ‚úÖ This works!
response = http.request('GET', f'https://lockout.techtalkwitheric.com/index.html')
```

**Key Lesson**: Export the DNS alias, not the CloudFront domain, from your CDK stack:
```json
"ssm_exports": {
  "dns_alias": "/dev/my-app/secondary-site/dns-alias",
  "cloudfront_domain": "/dev/my-app/secondary-site/cloudfront-domain"  // ‚ùå Don't use this for proxy mode
}
```

### Gotcha #2: Missing Default Parameter Support

**The Problem:**
Our Lambda function crashed with:
```
TypeError: get_ssm_parameter() got an unexpected keyword argument 'default'
```

We were calling:
```python
response_mode = get_ssm_parameter(param_name, default='redirect')
```

But the function signature didn't support it:
```python
def get_ssm_parameter(parameter_name: str, region: str = 'us-east-1') -> str:
```

**The Solution:**
Add proper default parameter support with graceful fallback:
```python
def get_ssm_parameter(parameter_name: str, region: str = 'us-east-1', default: str = None) -> str:
    """Fetch SSM parameter with optional default value."""
    try:
        response = ssm.get_parameter(Name=parameter_name, WithDecryption=False)
        return response['Parameter']['Value']
    except ssm.exceptions.ParameterNotFound:
        if default is not None:
            print(f"Parameter {parameter_name} not found, using default: {default}")
            return default
        raise
    except Exception as e:
        if default is not None:
            print(f"Error fetching {parameter_name}, using default: {default}")
            return default
        raise
```

**Key Lesson**: Lambda@Edge errors take 30 minutes to deploy fixes. Comprehensive unit tests are not optional‚Äîthey're essential.

### Gotcha #3: SSM Parameter Path Consistency

**The Problem:**
We accidentally used inconsistent SSM parameter paths:
```python
# ‚ùå Missing environment prefix
response_mode = get_ssm_parameter(f"/{function_name}/response-mode")

# ‚úÖ Correct format with environment
response_mode = get_ssm_parameter(f"/{env}/{function_name}/response-mode")
```

CDK auto-generates SSM paths as `/{environment}/{function-name}/{key}`, but it's easy to forget the environment prefix in code.

**The Solution:**
Maintain strict path conventions and document them:
```python
# Standard SSM parameter path format:
# /{env}/{function_name}/{parameter-name}

# Examples:
# /dev/tech-talk-dev-ip-gate/gate-enabled
# /dev/tech-talk-dev-ip-gate/allow-cidrs
# /dev/tech-talk-dev-ip-gate/dns-alias
# /dev/tech-talk-dev-ip-gate/response-mode
```

**Key Lesson**: Document your SSM parameter naming conventions and validate them in tests.

### Gotcha #4: Proxy Mode Needs Explicit Path

**The Problem:**
Fetching the root path returned 403:
```python
# ‚ùå Returns 403
response = http.request('GET', f'https://{dns_alias}')
```

**The Solution:**
Always request the explicit file:
```python
# ‚úÖ Works!
response = http.request('GET', f'https://{dns_alias}/index.html')
```

CloudFront distributions need an explicit path even if you have a default root object configured. This is because the proxy request bypasses CloudFront's automatic index.html resolution.

### Gotcha #5: Python Naming Conventions

**The Problem:**
We initially used `DNS_ALIAS` (all caps) as a variable name, which violates Python conventions where all-caps indicates a module-level constant.

**The Solution:**
```python
# ‚ùå Looks like a constant but it's a variable
DNS_ALIAS = get_ssm_parameter(f'/{env}/{function_name}/dns-alias', 'us-east-1')

# ‚úÖ Proper snake_case for variables
dns_alias = get_ssm_parameter(f'/{env}/{function_name}/dns-alias', 'us-east-1')
```

**Key Lesson**: Even simple scripts benefit from following language conventions‚Äîit makes code more maintainable.

### Gotcha #6: Displaying the User's IP Address

**Enhancement:**
We added IP address display to the lockout page using a client-side API call:
```html
<p>
  Your current IP address 
  (<strong><span id="user-ip">Loading...</span></strong>) 
  is not on the authorized list.
</p>

<script>
  fetch('https://api.ipify.org?format=json')
    .then(response => response.json())
    .then(data => {
      document.getElementById('user-ip').textContent = data.ip;
    })
    .catch(() => {
      document.getElementById('user-ip').textContent = 'Unable to detect';
    });
</script>
```

**Key Lesson**: Small UX improvements make a big difference. Users can now copy their IP and send it to admins for allowlist updates.

### Testing Strategy That Saved Us

After the first round of bugs, we implemented comprehensive pytest tests:

```python
@patch('handler.get_ssm_parameter')
def test_proxy_mode_uses_dns_alias(mock_get_ssm):
    """Verify proxy mode uses DNS alias, not CloudFront domain."""
    mock_get_ssm.side_effect = lambda name, region, default=None: {
        '/dev/my-app/gate-enabled': 'true',
        '/dev/my-app/allow-cidrs': '10.0.0.0/8',
        '/dev/my-app/dns-alias': 'lockout.example.com',
        '/dev/my-app/response-mode': 'proxy'
    }.get(name, default)
    
    # Test blocked IP triggers proxy mode
    event = create_test_event(client_ip='1.2.3.4')
    result = handler.lambda_handler(event, mock_context)
    
    # Verify the proxy URL uses dns-alias
    assert 'lockout.example.com' in result['body']
```

These tests caught issues before deployment, saving 30-minute deployment cycles.

## Lambda@Edge IP Gating: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

### The Good ‚úÖ

**1. Extremely Cost-Effective**

For most non-production environments, Lambda@Edge IP gating costs pennies:

| Traffic/Month | Lambda@Edge Cost |
|---------------|------------------|
| 10,000 requests (small dev site) | $0.01 |
| 100,000 requests (active staging) | $0.07 |
| 1,000,000 requests (busy internal portal) | $0.66 |

Compare this to AWS WAF's base cost of $5/month + $1/million requests, and the savings are clear for low-traffic sites.

**2. Simple to Implement**

With CDK Factory, it's literally one line of configuration. No complex rule sets, no learning curve, no separate service to manage.

**3. Flexible and Dynamic**

Update the allow-list in SSM Parameter Store without redeploying:
- Add a new partner organization? Update SSM, wait 5 minutes.
- Remote employee needs access? Add their home IP, done.
- Emergency block? Update and it propagates in minutes.

**4. Works Everywhere**

Lambda@Edge runs at CloudFront edge locations globally. Whether your user is in Tokyo or Toronto, the IP check happens at the nearest edge location with consistent <10ms latency.

**5. Perfect for Dev/Staging**

This is where Lambda@Edge IP gating truly shines:
- Development sites with 1,000-10,000 requests/month
- Staging environments with occasional stakeholder access
- Internal tools with predictable usage patterns
- Partner portals with limited user bases

**6. Maintenance Mode Built-In**

The "gate-enabled" flag lets you instantly switch between gated and maintenance mode:

```bash
# Enable gate (block unauthorized IPs)
aws ssm put-parameter --name "/dev/my-app/gate-enabled" --value "true" --overwrite

# Disable gate (everyone redirected to maintenance page)
aws ssm put-parameter --name "/dev/my-app/gate-enabled" --value "false" --overwrite
```

Perfect for deployments or scheduled maintenance.

### The Bad ‚ö†Ô∏è

**1. Not Free for High Traffic**

While $0.66/month for 1M requests is cheap, it scales linearly:
- 10M requests/month: ~$6.60
- 50M requests/month: ~$33.00
- 100M requests/month: ~$66.00

At very high traffic volumes (>10M requests/month), AWS WAF becomes competitive.

**2. IP-Based Security Has Limitations**

IP addresses aren't perfect security:
- **Shared IPs**: Multiple users might share the same corporate NAT gateway
- **Dynamic IPs**: Home users' IPs change periodically
- **VPN hopping**: Determined attackers can use VPNs from allowed IP ranges
- **IP spoofing**: (Mostly mitigated by CloudFront, but worth noting)

For truly sensitive data, you need authentication (OAuth, SAML, etc.), not just IP gating.

**3. Management Overhead for Large Allow-Lists**

If you have 100+ partner organizations each with multiple office locations, maintaining the allow-list in SSM becomes tedious. You might want to:
- Build an API for self-service IP management
- Integrate with your identity provider
- Consider authentication instead

**4. CloudFront-Specific**

Lambda@Edge only works with CloudFront distributions. If you're using:
- Direct ALB/API Gateway access
- S3 website hosting (without CloudFront)
- EC2 instances with Elastic IPs

You'll need a different solution (security groups, WAF, etc.).

**5. Cold Start Latency**

Lambda@Edge has cold start latency (typically 50-200ms):
- First request from a region: slower
- Subsequent requests: cached, fast (~5-10ms)
- For most use cases, this is imperceptible
- For latency-critical applications (gaming, real-time trading), this matters

### The Ugly üò±

**1. Lambda@Edge Deployment is SLOW**

When you update a Lambda@Edge function, it takes **20-30 minutes** to propagate globally to all CloudFront edge locations. 

If you find a bug in your IP validation logic, you're waiting half an hour for the fix to deploy. 

**Mitigation**: Test thoroughly! Use the SSM parameters for configuration changes (instant) rather than code changes.

**Real-world example**: We discovered a bug where `get_ssm_parameter()` was being called with a `default` keyword argument that the function didn't support. The fix took 2 minutes to code, but 30 minutes to deploy and test. This is why thorough unit testing is critical for Lambda@Edge.

**2. Lambda@Edge Limits are Strict**

Lambda@Edge has tighter limits than regular Lambda:
- **Max memory**: 10,240MB (but you only need 128MB for IP checks)
- **Max execution time**: 5 seconds for viewer request (plenty for IP validation)
- **Package size**: 50MB (compressed), 250MB (uncompressed)
- **Environment variables**: 4KB limit (use SSM instead)

For IP gating, these limits aren't a problem, but they prevent more complex use cases.

**3. Debugging is Harder**

Lambda@Edge logs are scattered across CloudWatch Logs in every region where it executes. When debugging:
- Check logs in **all regions** where CloudFront has edge locations
- Logs are in the region closest to the user, not your primary region
- Makes troubleshooting more complex than regular Lambda

**Pro tip**: Use structured logging (JSON) and aggregate logs with CloudWatch Insights.

**4. No Local Testing**

You can't run Lambda@Edge locally with the same CloudFront context. Testing requires:
- Deploying to AWS (30-minute wait)
- Or mocking the CloudFront event structure (tedious)

We've built comprehensive test harnesses with pytest that mock:
- CloudFront request events
- SSM parameter responses
- Runtime configuration files
- Multiple environment scenarios

This catches 90% of bugs before deployment, but it's still not as smooth as regular Lambda development.

## When to Use AWS WAF Instead

AWS WAF (Web Application Firewall) is a different beast entirely. Here's when it makes sense:

### Choose AWS WAF When:

**1. High Traffic (>10M Requests/Month)**

**Cost comparison:**
- 10M requests: Lambda@Edge $6.60 vs WAF $15.00
- 50M requests: Lambda@Edge $33.00 vs WAF $55.00
- 100M requests: Lambda@Edge $66.00 vs WAF $105.00

While Lambda@Edge is still cheaper, WAF offers more features for the price at high volumes.

**2. You Need Complex Rules**

WAF excels at sophisticated traffic filtering:
- **Rate limiting**: Block IPs making >1000 requests/minute
- **Geo-blocking**: Block entire countries
- **SQL injection detection**: Built-in threat detection
- **XSS protection**: Inspect request bodies for attacks
- **Bot mitigation**: Integrate with AWS Shield for DDoS protection
- **Managed rule sets**: Subscribe to AWS or third-party threat intelligence

Lambda@Edge IP gating is simple: allow or deny based on IP. WAF is a full security suite.

**3. Compliance Requirements**

Many compliance frameworks explicitly require a WAF:
- PCI DSS 6.6: Web application firewall for cardholder data
- HIPAA: WAF often required for PHI-handling applications
- SOC 2: WAF demonstrates security controls
- ISO 27001: WAF is a common control

If auditors ask "do you have a WAF?", Lambda@Edge won't suffice.

**4. Production Applications**

For production public-facing applications:
- **DDoS protection**: WAF integrates with AWS Shield Advanced
- **OWASP Top 10**: WAF protects against common web vulnerabilities
- **Managed threat intelligence**: Automatically updated rules
- **Advanced logging**: Integration with AWS Security Hub, GuardDuty

Your production app deserves production-grade security.

**5. Multiple Applications**

One WAF Web ACL can protect multiple CloudFront distributions, ALBs, and API Gateways. If you have:
- 10 CloudFront distributions
- Each needs IP filtering
- Cost: $5 base + $1/rule + $1/million requests

Shared infrastructure makes WAF more cost-effective at scale.

### AWS WAF: The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly

#### The Good ‚úÖ

**1. Comprehensive Security**
- IP allow/deny lists (like Lambda@Edge)
- Rate limiting (block DDoS)
- Geo-blocking (block entire countries)
- SQL injection protection
- XSS detection
- Custom regex patterns
- Managed rule groups (OWASP, bot control)

**2. Better for Production**
- Battle-tested by millions of applications
- Integration with AWS Security Hub
- Compliance certifications (PCI, HIPAA)
- Advanced DDoS protection with Shield

**3. Instant Updates**
- Rule changes take seconds, not 30 minutes
- No deployment required
- No code to maintain

**4. Centralized Management**
- One WAF protects multiple resources
- Unified logging and monitoring
- AWS Firewall Manager for enterprise

**5. Predictable Pricing**
- $5/month base (per Web ACL)
- $1/month per rule
- $1 per million requests
- No surprise charges

#### The Bad ‚ö†Ô∏è

**1. Base Cost**
- Minimum $5/month even for 0 requests
- For a dev site with 10K requests/month, you're paying $5.00 vs $0.01 with Lambda@Edge
- Not economical for low-traffic dev/staging

**2. More Complex**
- Learning curve for rule configuration
- WAF has its own query language
- More moving parts to maintain
- Requires understanding of web security concepts

**3. Rule Limits**
- 1,500 Web ACL capacity units per Web ACL
- Complex rules consume more capacity units
- May need multiple Web ACLs for complex requirements

**4. IP List Maintenance**
- IP sets limited to 10,000 IP addresses
- Managing large lists requires automation
- No built-in TTL or expiration

#### The Ugly üò±

**1. Easy to Misconfigure**
- Accidentally block legitimate traffic
- Allow malicious traffic through
- Complex rule interactions are hard to debug
- "Default allow" vs "default deny" confusion

**2. Costs Can Escalate**
- $1/million requests adds up fast
- 100M requests/month = $100 just for WAF
- Bot inspection adds $10/million requests
- AWS Shield Advanced: $3,000/month

**3. Limited Testing**
- No local testing environment
- Staging WAF costs same as production
- Hard to test rules without live traffic

## The Hybrid Approach: Start Simple, Scale Up

Here's the strategy we recommend:

### Stage 1: Development (Lambda@Edge)
```
Traffic: 1K-10K requests/month
Cost: <$0.10/month
Security: IP gating for office/VPN
```

**Use Lambda@Edge** because:
- Costs almost nothing
- Simple to implement
- Easy to maintain
- Sufficient for internal access control

### Stage 2: Staging (Lambda@Edge)
```
Traffic: 10K-100K requests/month
Cost: $0.07-$0.70/month
Security: IP gating for team + clients
```

**Stick with Lambda@Edge** because:
- Still very cheap
- Stakeholder access is IP-based anyway
- No compliance requirements yet
- Development velocity matters more

### Stage 3: Production Beta (Lambda@Edge or WAF)
```
Traffic: 100K-1M requests/month
Cost: Lambda@Edge $0.66 vs WAF $6.00
Security: IP gating for beta users
```

**Decision point:**
- **Lambda@Edge** if beta is invite-only with known IP ranges
- **WAF** if you need rate limiting or bot protection

### Stage 4: Public Production (WAF)
```
Traffic: 1M-100M+ requests/month
Cost: WAF $15-$105/month
Security: Full web application firewall
```

**Use AWS WAF** because:
- Production deserves production security
- Rate limiting prevents DDoS
- Managed rules protect against OWASP Top 10
- Compliance requirements
- Cost is now <10% of total infrastructure

## The Decision Matrix

Use this to decide which solution fits your needs:

| Criteria | Lambda@Edge IP Gating | AWS WAF |
|----------|----------------------|---------|
| **Traffic < 1M/month** | ‚úÖ Best choice | ‚ö†Ô∏è Overkill |
| **Traffic 1M-10M/month** | ‚úÖ Cost-effective | ‚ö†Ô∏è More features, higher cost |
| **Traffic > 10M/month** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Still works, but pricey | ‚úÖ Better value |
| **Dev/Staging only** | ‚úÖ Perfect fit | ‚ùå Unnecessary expense |
| **Production public site** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Basic protection only | ‚úÖ Recommended |
| **Simple IP allow-list** | ‚úÖ Exactly right | ‚ö†Ô∏è Overengineered |
| **Complex security rules** | ‚ùå Can't do this | ‚úÖ Built for this |
| **Rate limiting needed** | ‚ùå Not supported | ‚úÖ Core feature |
| **Geo-blocking needed** | üî® Possible but hacky | ‚úÖ Native support |
| **Compliance required** | ‚ùå Not sufficient | ‚úÖ Certified |
| **Quick configuration changes** | ‚ö†Ô∏è SSM (5 min), Code (30 min) | ‚úÖ Instant |
| **Cost predictability** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Scales with traffic | ‚úÖ Fixed base + linear |
| **Ease of implementation** | ‚úÖ One-line config | ‚ö†Ô∏è Learning curve |
| **Debugging difficulty** | ‚ö†Ô∏è Logs in all regions | ‚úÖ Centralized logs |

## Real-World Success Story

At our company, we rolled out Lambda@Edge IP gating across **15 CloudFront distributions**:

**Dev Environments (10 sites):**
- Traffic: 5K-20K requests/month each
- Lambda@Edge cost: $0.01-$0.15/month per site
- Total: **$0.50/month for 10 dev sites**
- Equivalent with WAF: $50/month (10 Web ACLs)
- **Savings: $594/year**

**Staging Environments (3 sites):**
- Traffic: 50K-100K requests/month each
- Lambda@Edge cost: $0.30-$0.70/month per site
- Total: **$1.50/month for 3 staging sites**
- Equivalent with WAF: $15/month
- **Savings: $162/year**

**Partner Portal (1 site):**
- Traffic: 200K requests/month
- Lambda@Edge cost: $1.20/month
- Equivalent with WAF: $6/month
- **Savings: $57.60/year**

**Production Site (1 site):**
- Traffic: 25M requests/month
- **Using AWS WAF**: $30/month
- Lambda@Edge would cost: $16.50/month
- **Extra cost worth it** for rate limiting, bot protection, compliance

**Total Annual Savings: $813.60**

More importantly, we:
- ‚úÖ Locked down all dev/staging environments (no more competitor snooping)
- ‚úÖ Gave stakeholders easy access (no VPN setup)
- ‚úÖ Met compliance requirements for production (WAF + Shield)
- ‚úÖ Maintained flexibility (SSM parameters for quick updates)

## Implementation with CDK Factory

With CDK Factory, implementing IP gating is trivial:

```json
{
  "stacks": [
    {
      "name": "my-app-secondary-site",
      "module": "static_website_stack",
      "enabled": true,
      "dns": {
        "aliases": ["lockout.example.com"]
      },
      "ssm_exports": {
        "dns_alias": "/dev/my-app/secondary-site/dns-alias",
        "cloudfront_domain": "/dev/my-app/secondary-site/cloudfront-domain"
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "my-app-ip-gate",
      "module": "lambda_edge_library_module",
      "dependencies": ["my-app-secondary-site"],
      "lambda_edge": {
        "name": "my-app-ip-gate",
        "runtime": "python3.11",
        "handler": "handler.lambda_handler",
        "code_path": "cdk_factory:lambdas/edge/ip_gate",
        "environment": {
          "GATE_ENABLED": "true",
          "ALLOW_CIDRS": "10.0.0.0/8,192.168.0.0/16",
          "DNS_ALIAS": "{{ssm:/dev/my-app/secondary-site/dns-alias}}",
          "RESPONSE_MODE": "proxy"
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "my-app-site",
      "module": "static_website_stack",
      "dependencies": ["my-app-ip-gate"],
      "cloudfront": {
        "enable_ip_gating": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

Behind the scenes, CDK Factory:
1. Creates the Lambda@Edge function from your code
2. Sets up SSM parameters with sensible defaults
3. Configures IAM permissions for SSM access
4. Associates the function with CloudFront's viewer-request event
5. Handles the Lambda@Edge deployment (the slow part)
6. Validates the setup with explicit stack dependencies

**Initial setup**: 30 minutes (Lambda@Edge propagation)
**Updating allow-list**: 5 minutes (SSM cache expiration)
**Cost**: $0.01-$10/month depending on traffic

## Conclusion: The Right Tool for the Job

**Lambda@Edge IP gating is the Swiss Army knife for non-production environments:**
- ‚úÖ Incredibly cost-effective for low-traffic sites
- ‚úÖ Simple to implement and maintain
- ‚úÖ Perfect for dev, staging, partner portals, and beta programs
- ‚úÖ Flexible with dynamic SSM-based configuration

**AWS WAF is the professional security solution for production:**
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive protection against web attacks
- ‚úÖ Rate limiting and DDoS prevention
- ‚úÖ Compliance certifications
- ‚úÖ Better value at high traffic volumes (>10M requests/month)

**Our recommendation:**
1. **Start with Lambda@Edge** for all dev/staging environments
2. **Save $500-1000/year** on unnecessary WAF costs
3. **Graduate to WAF** when you go to production
4. **Sleep better** knowing your production site has enterprise-grade security

The best part? You don't have to choose just one. Use Lambda@Edge where it makes sense (dev/staging/internal), and WAF where it matters (production). 

That's the beauty of cloud architecture: use the right tool for each job.
